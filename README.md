# Angular 1 in an Angular 2 Style
It was an alarming experience for most Angular 1 developers the first time they saw Angular 2. In fact, pretty much **everything** changed. We were faced with learning a new language, new syntax, new tooling, etc. and it was overwhelming. The 5-minute quick start was more like a 25-minute quick start that included a 20-minute scenic tour into a ton of new stuff seemingly unrelated to Angular.

As I began to learn Angular 2, a funny thing happened. My entire worldview on Angular 1 began to shift towards a cleaner, more elegant approach as I began to apply the concepts that were self-evident in Angular 2. I just wanted to write Angular 1 apps like an Angular 2 application because it felt "right."

## The Ethos of Angular 2

Eventually, I started to make the distinction between "the architecture" and "the implementation" when talking about Angular 2. I did not have to wait for the right business opportunity or buy-in arrived for me to start benefiting from the architecture or *ethos* of Angular 2.

The best practices that emerged from Angular 1 had been made the default in Angular 2. Significant portions of the framework were left on the cutting floor as the Angular team decided for letting vanilla JavaScript and HTML do the hard work. We had twice the power with half the framework.

## The Goal

And the best part of this brave new world is that a lot of the architectural principles have been back-ported into Angular 1, and we can start using them right now. We are going to work through a series of easy to follow, practical techniques that you can apply to your existing Angular 1 applications in an iterative and pragmatic manner.

Writing an Angular 1 application in an Angular 2 style invariably gets us **a lot** further down the road with the migration talk but we should not limit ourselves to just that context. Writing an Angular 1 application in an Angular 2 means that we are writing better Angular 1 apps. **Much better**.
